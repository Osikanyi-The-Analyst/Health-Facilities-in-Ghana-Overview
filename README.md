# Health Facilities in Ghana Dashboard
This project visualizes the distribution of health facilities in Ghana by region, ownership, type, and population density. The data was obtained from the Ghana Open Data Initiative and Wikipedia, and was analyzed and visualized using Tableau.

## Data Sources
The following datasets were used for this project:

1. Health Facilities in Ghana: health-facilities-gh and health-facility-tiers from Kaggle.
2. Regional Population in Ghana: web scrapped from Wikipedia.
3. Regional Area in Ghana: web scrapped from Wikipedia.

## Tableau Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. Facilities by Region: displays the number of health facilities in each region of Ghana.
2. Facilities by Ownership: displays the distribution of health facilities by ownership type (public, private, or quasi-government).
3. Facilities Area Density: displays the density of health facilities per square kilometer for each region of Ghana.
4. Facilities Population Density: displays the density of health facilities per 10,000 people for each region of Ghana.
5. Facilities by Type: displays the distribution of health facilities by type (hospitals, clinics, health directorates, maternity homes, health centers, CHPS, RCH, directorates, and others).
6. Regional Key Indicators: shows key indicators such as the total number of facilities, and the count and percentage of each facility type.
